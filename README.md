# Breast Cancer ML Project

This project trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models for binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset (from scikit-learn).
The goal is to compare different models, compute several medical-relevant metrics, save trained models, and generate diagnostic plots such as ROC curves and confusion matrices.

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing 
- Several classical ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Ensemble learning with VotingClassifier
- Training, evaluation, and comparison across multiple metrics
- Saving trained models using joblib
- Generating:
  - Confusion matrices (saved as images)
  - ROC curves 
- Full reproducibility via Docker

## Requirements

- Python 3.14
- pip
- (optional) Docker Desktop

---

## Outputs generated by the script

After running train.py, the script automatically creates the following folders:

outputs/
    confusion_matrices/
    roc_curves/
models/

Each folder may contain:

- models/  -> trained models saved as .joblib
- outputs/confusion_matrices/ -> PNG images for confusion matrices
- outputs/roc_curves/ -> combined ROC curve

These folders are created automatically via Python using mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True).

---

## Docker Image

Docker allows running the project in a fully isolated and reproducible environment.

### Build the Docker image

```powershell
docker build -t breast_cancer_ml .
```
If you want to publish this image, you may also tag it:

```powershell
docker tag breast_cancer_ml mydockerhubaccount/breast_cancer_ml:latest
```
The project is also available as a Docker image on Docker Hub:

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fairfriend92/breast_cancer_ml)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fairfriend92/breast_cancer_ml)

Pull the image and run:

```powershell
docker pull fairfriend92/breast_cancer_ml:latest
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/models:/breast_cancer_ml_app/models fairfriend92/breast_cancer_ml:latest
```

### Run the container with output folders mounted

```powershell
docker run --rm `
  -v ${PWD}/models:/breast_cancer_ml_app/models `
  -v ${PWD}/outputs:/breast_cancer_ml_app/outputs `
  breast_cancer_ml
```

Inside the container, the script writes to:

/breast_cancer_ml_app/models
/breast_cancer_ml_app/outputs

Since they are mounted, everything appears on your local machine too.

### Notes on Docker folders

You do NOT need to create all subfolders manually in the Dockerfile.
The Python script automatically creates:

/breast_cancer_ml_app/outputs
/breast_cancer_ml_app/outputs/confusion_matrices
/breast_cancer_ml_app/outputs/roc_curves

because it uses:

Path(...).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

## Using a Python virtual environment (venv)

### Create and activate venv

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the training script

```powershell
python src/train.py
```

### Deactivate the virtual environment

```powershell
deactivate
```
